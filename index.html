But over the last few decad es, this occasional feeling has become chronic for millions. In the UK, 60% of 18 to 34 year old say they often feel lonely. In the US, 46% of the entire population feel lonely regularly. We are living in the most connected time in human history, and yet, an unprecedented number of us feel isolated. </div>

        <section id="section-synopsis-detail">
            Being lonely and being alone are not the same thing. You can be filled by bliss by yourself, and hate every second surrounded by friends. Loneliness is a purely subjective, individual experience. If you feel lonely, you are lonely. A common stereotype is that loneliness only happens to people who don't know how to talk to people, or how to behave around others. But population-based studies have shown that social skills make practically no difference for adults when it comes to social connections. 
            <br/><br/>
            Loneliness can affect everybody. Money, fame,power, beauty, social skills, a great personality— nothing can protect you against loneliness, because it's part of your biology.

                <h2>Origin</h2>
                <p class="origin-para-c">Loneliness is a bodily function, like hunger. Hunger make you pay attention to your physical needs; loneliness makes you pay attention to your social needs. </p>
                <p class="origin-para-rs">Your body cares about your social needs, because millions of years ago, it was a great indicator of how likely you were to survive. Natural selection rewarded our ancestors for collaboration, and for forming connections with each other.</p>
                <p class="origin-para-ls">Our brains grew and became more and more fine-tuned to recognize what others thought and felt, and to form and sustain social bonds. Being social became part of our biology You were born into groups of 50 to 150 people, which you usually stayed with for the rest of your life. </p>
                <p class="origin-para-rs">Getting enough calories, staying safe and warm, or caring for offspring was practically impossible alone. Being together meant survival, being alone meant death.</p>
                <p class="origin-para-ls">So it was crucial that you got along with others. For you ancestors, the most dangerous threat to survival was not being eaten by a lion, but not getting the social vibe of your group and being excluded. To avoid that, your body came up with "social pain".</p>
                <p class="origin-para-rs">Pain of this kind is is an evolutionary adaptation to rejection. A sort of early warning system to make sure you stop behaviour that would isolate you.</p>
                <p class="origin-para-ls">Your ancestors who experienced rejection as more painful were more likely to change their behaviour when they got rejected, and thus stayed in the tribe, while those who did not got kicked out and most likely died.</p>
                <p class="origin-para-c">That's why rejections hurt, and even more so, why loneliness is so painful. These mechanisms for keeping us connected worked great for most of our history, until humans began building a new world for themselves. </p>

                <h2>Causes</h2>
                <p class="cause-para-c">The loneliness epidemic we see today really only started in the late Renaissance. Western culture began to focus on the individual. Intellectuals moved away from the collectivism of the Middle Ages, while the young Protestant theology stressed individual responsibility.</p>
                <p class="cause-para-ls">This trend accelerated during the Industrial Revolution. People left their villages and fields to enter factories.</p>
                <p class="cause-para-rs">Communities that had existed for hundreds of years began to dissolve, while cities grew. As our world rapidly became modern, this trend sped up more and more. </p>
                <p class="cause-para-ls">Today, we move vast distances for new jobs, love, and education, and leave our social net behind. We meet fewer people in person, and we meet them less often than in the past.</p>
                <p class="cause-para-rs">In the US, the mean number of close friends dropped from 3 in 1985 to 2 in 2011. </p>
                <p class="cause-para-ls">Most people stumble into chronic loneliness by accident. You reach adulthood and become busy with work, university, romance, kids, and Netflix.There's just not enough time.</p>
                <p class="cause-para-rs">The most convenient and easy thing to sacrifice is time with friends. Until you wake up one day and you realise that you feel isolated, that you yearn for close relationships.</p>
                <p class="cause-para-ls">But it's hard to find close relationships as adults, and so, loneliness can become chronic.</p>
                <p class="cause-para-c">While humans feel pretty great about things like iPhones and spaceships,our bodies and minds are fundamentally the same they were 50,000 years ago. We are still biologically fine-tuned to being with each other.</p>

                        Untreated depression increases the chance of risky behaviors such as drug or alcohol addiction. It also can ruin relationships, cause problems at work, and make it difficult to overcome serious illnesses.<br/><br/>
                        Depression can render people disabled in their work life, family life, and social life. Left untreated, clinical depression is as costly as heart disease or AIDS to the U.S. economy. Untreated depression is responsible for more than 200 million days lost from work each year. The annual cost of untreated depression is more than $43.7 billion in absenteeism from work, lost productivity, and direct treatment costs.            
                        <h3>Physical Health:-</h3>
                        The most recent studies exploring health and major depression have looked at patients with stroke or coronary artery disease. Results have shown that people with major depression who are recovering from strokes or heart attacks have a more difficult time making health care choices. They also find it more difficult to follow their doctor's instructions and to cope with the challenges their illness presents. Another study found that patients with major depression have a higher risk of death in the first few months after a heart attack.<br/><br/>

                        <h3>Depression in Men and Women:-</h3>
                        Men who have untreated clinical depression may exhibit more anger, frustration, and violent behavior than women. In addition, men with untreated depression may take dangerous risks such as reckless driving and having unsafe sex. Men are not aware that physical origin, such as headaches, digestive disorders and chronic pain, can be origin of depression.
                        <h3>suicide:-</h3>
                        Most people who suffer from clinical depression do not attempt suicide. But according to the National Institute of Mental Health, more than 90% of people who die from suicide have depression and other mental disorders, or a substance abuse disorder. Men commit almost 75% of suicides, even though twice as many women attempt it.<br/><br/>
                        The elderly experience more depression and suicide than you might think. Forty percent of all suicide victims are adults over the age of 60. Older adults suffer more frequently from depression because of the frequent loss of loved ones and friends as they age. They also experience more chronic illnesses, more major life changes like retirement, and the transition into assisted living or nursing care.

To someone with depression, these first steps can seem insurmountable.
